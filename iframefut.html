<li>First of all I'm a person who thinks we need to find an alternative planet to live.Our sources are limited and eventually it has
to be drain away.So I want to be a part of a SpaceX project.Because they are the closest one to find a way to live in another world and I want to
be a part of space revolution</li>

I want to find solutions about environment problems  </li>
