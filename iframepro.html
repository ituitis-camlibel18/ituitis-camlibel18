<ol class="ol2" style="color:wheat;"> <p> I want to tell you about my projects:</p>
<li>When I was a student I was in a company that sells sport datas and presents online betting service.I had have a project that is called "Win-win betting".
By that project we could calculate the best bet ratio to profit.</li>
<li>"The Healty Farm Project" can detect the presympthoms on animals if there is any and inform the farmer </li>
<li>"Surface" is a very simple programme that we can animate the behaviour of objects in  any kind of surface and wheather conditions.It is not directly attached with
NASA.Actually it's a project of my own company so that we could rent this programme to game companies also </li>
